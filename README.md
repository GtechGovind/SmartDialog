# Android BLE Library

An Android library that solves a lot of Android's Bluetooth Low Energy problems.

## Importing

The library may be found on Maven Central repository.
Add it to your project by adding the following dependency:

```groovy
implementation 'no.nordicsemi.android:ble:2.6.0-alpha03'
```
The last version not migrated to AndroidX is 2.0.5.

BLE library with Kotlin extension is available in:
```groovy
implementation 'no.nordicsemi.android:ble-ktx:2.6.0-alpha03'
```

To import the BLE library with set of parsers for common Bluetooth SIG characteristics, use:
```groovy
implementation 'no.nordicsemi.android:ble-common:2.6.0-alpha03'
```
For more information, read [this](BLE-COMMON.md).

An extension for easier integration with `LiveData` is available after adding:
```groovy
implementation 'no.nordicsemi.android:ble-livedata:2.6.0-alpha03'
```
This extension adds `ObservableBleManager` with `state` and `bondingState` properties, which
notify about connection and bond state using `androidx.lifecycle.LiveData`.

<details>
	<summary>Importing as a module</summary>

Clone this project and add it to your project:

1. In *settings.gradle* file add the following lines:
```groovy
if (file('../Android-BLE-Library').exists()) {
    includeBuild('../Android-BLE-Library')
}
```
2. Sync project and build it.

The library uses Java 1.8 features. If you're using Android Studio below 4.2, make sure your
*build.gradle* includes the following configuration:

```groovy
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    // For Kotlin projects additionally:
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "1.8"
    }
```
</details>

## Features

**BleManager** class provides the following features:

1. Connection, with automatic retries
2. Service discovery
3. Bonding (optional) and removing bond information (using reflections)
4. Automatic handling of Service Changed indications
5. Device initialization
6. Asynchronous and synchronous BLE operations using queue
7. Splitting and merging long packets when writing and reading characteristics and descriptors
8. Requesting MTU and connection priority (on Android Lollipop or newer)
9. Reading and setting preferred PHY (on Android Oreo or newer)
10. Reading RSSI
11. Refreshing device cache (using reflections)
12. Reliable Write support
13. Operation timeouts (for *connect*, *disconnect* and *wait for notification* requests)
14. Error handling
15. Logging
16. GATT server (since version 2.2)
17. Kotlin support (coroutines, Flow, ...) (since version 2.3)

> Note:
  The library **does not provide support for scanning** for Bluetooth LE devices.
  Instead, we recommend using
  [Android Scanner Compat Library](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-Scanner-Compat-Library)
  which brings almost all recent features, introduced in Lollipop and later, to the older platforms.

### Recent changes

<details>
	<summary>Version 2.4</summary>

1. More `:ble-ktx` extensions.
	1. `.suspendForResponse()` and `.suspendForValidResponse()` extension methods added to read and write requests.
	2. `.asResponseFlow()` and `.asValidResponseFlow()` methods added to `ValueChangedCallback`.
	3. `.stateAsFlow()` and `.bondingStateAsFlow()` in `BleManager` now return the same flow when called multiple times.
	4. Progress indications for split outgoing data and merged incoming data can be observed as `Flow` using
	   `splitWithProgressFlow(...)` and `mergeWithProgressFlow(...)`.
2. A new `then(...)` method added to `ValueChangedCallback` which will be called when the callback has been unregistered,
   or the device has invalidated services (i.e. it has disconnected). Useful to release resources.
3. A new option to remove a handler from each `Request` using `setHandler(null)`, which will make the callbacks
   called immediately from the worker looper.
4. Option to filter logs by priority. By default only logs on `Log.INFO` or higher will now be logged. Use
   `getMinLogPriority()` to return a different value if needed. Logs with lower priority will not be produced
   at all, making the library less laggy (parsing incoming data to hex takes notable time).
5. Added support for Big Endian format types with the new `Data.FORMAT_xxx_BE` types. Also, `FORMAT_xxx` have been
   deprecated in favor of `FORMAT_xxx_LE`.
6. All user callbacks (`before`, `with`, `then`, `fail`, ...) are now wrapped in `try-catch` blocks.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Version 2.3</summary>

1. `:ble-ktx` module added with support for coroutines and Flow.
	1. `.suspend()` methods added in `Request`s.
	2. `asFlow()` method added to `ValueChangedCallback`.
	3. Connection and bonding state available as Flow.
	4. New helper methods to get a `BluetoothGattCharacteristic` with given required properties
	   and instance id added to `BluetoothGattService`.
2. `JsonMerger` class added, which should help with use cases when a device sends a JSON file in multiple
	packets.
3. `:ble-livedata` migrated to Java with some API changes, as sealed classes are no longer available.
4. Support for new `onServicesChanged()` callback, added in API 31 (Android 12).
5. Option to cancel pending Bluetooth LE connection using `ConnectRequest.cancelPendingConnection()`.

When using coroutines, use `.suspend()` method in `Request`, instead of `enqueue()` or `await()`.

To register to notifications and indications (or incoming write requests for server) use
```kotlin
setNotificationCallback(characteristic)
   .merge(JsonMerger()) // Example of how to use JsonMerger, optional
   .asFlow()
```
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Version 2.2</summary>

1. GATT Server support. This includes setting up the local GATT server on the Android device, new 
   requests for server operations: 
   * *wait for read*, 
   * *wait for write*, 
   * *send notification*, 
   * *send indication*,
   * *set characteristic value*,
   * *set descriptor value*.
2. New conditional requests: 
   * *wait if*,
   * *wait until*.
3. BLE operations are no longer called from the main thread.
4. There's a new option to set a handler for invoking callbacks. A handler can also be set per-callback.

Version 2.2 breaks some API known from version 2.1.1.
Check out [migration guide](MIGRATION.md).
</details>

## Usage

A `BleManager` instance is responsible for connecting and communicating with a single peripheral.
Having multiple instances of the manager is possible to connect with multiple devices simultaneously.
The `BleManager` must be extended with your implementation where you define the high level device's API.

```java
class MyBleManager extends BleManager {
	private static final String TAG = "MyBleManager";

	private BluetoothGattCharacteristic fluxCapacitorControlPoint;

	public MyBleManager(@NonNull final Context context) {
		super(context);
	}

	@Override
	public int getMinLogPriority() {
		// Use to return minimal desired logging priority.
		return Log.VERBOSE;
	}

	@Override
	public void log(int priority, @NonNull String message) {
		// Log from here.
		Log.println(priority, TAG, message);
	}

 	@NonNull
	@Override
	protected BleManagerGattCallback getGattCallback() {
		return new MyGattCallbackImpl();
	}

	private class MyGattCallbackImpl extends BleManagerGattCallback {
		@Override
		protected boolean isRequiredServiceSupported(@NonNull BluetoothGatt gatt) {
			// Here get instances of your characteristics.
			// Return false if a required service has not been discovered.
			BluetoothGattService fluxCapacitorService = gatt.getService(FLUX_SERVICE_UUID);
			if (fluxCapacitorService != null) {
				fluxCapacitorControlPoint = fluxCapacitorService.getCharacteristic(FLUX_CHAR_UUID);
			}
			return fluxCapacitorControlPoint != null;
		}

		@Override
		protected void initialize() {
			// Initialize your device.
			// This means e.g. enabling notifications, setting notification callbacks,
			// sometimes writing something to some Control Point.
			// Kotlin projects should not use suspend methods here, which require a scope.
			requestMtu(517)
				.enqueue();
		}

		@Override
		protected void onServicesInvalidated() {
			// This method is called when the services get invalidated, i.e. when the device
			// disconnects.
			// References to characteristics should be nullified here.
			fluxCapacitorControlPoint = null;
		}
	}

	// Here you may add some high level methods for your device:
	public void enableFluxCapacitor() {
		// Do the magic.
		writeCharacteristic(fluxCapacitorControlPoint, Flux.enable(), BluetoothGattCharacteristic.WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE)
			.enqueue()
	}
}
```

The [BleManager](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-BLE-Library/blob/master/ble/src/main/java/no/nordicsemi/android/ble/BleManager.java)
class exposes high level API for connecting and communicating with Bluetooth LE peripherals.

```java
connect(bluetoothDevice)
	// Automatic retries are supported, in case of 133 error.
	.retry(3 /* times, with */, 100 /* ms interval */)
	// A connection timeout can be set. This is additional to the Android's connection timeout which is 30 seconds.
	.timeout(15_000 /* ms */)
	// The auto connect feature from connectGatt is available as well
	.useAutoConnect(true)
	// This API can be set on any Android version, but will only be used on devices running Android 8+ with
	// support to the selected PHY.
	.usePreferredPhy(PhyRequest.PHY_LE_1M_MASK | PhyRequest.PHY_LE_2M_MASK | PhyRequest.PHY_LE_CODED_MASK)
	// A connection timeout can be also set. This is additional to the Android's connection timeout which is 30 seconds.
	.timeout(15_000 /* ms */)
	// Each request has number of callbacks called in different situations:
	.before(device -> { /* called when the request is about to be executed */ })
	.done(device -> { /* called when the device has connected, has required services and has been initialized */ })
	.fail(device, status -> { /* called when the request has failed */ })
	.then(device -> { /* called when the request was finished with either success, or a failure */ })
	// Each request must be enqueued.
	// Kotlin projects can use suspend() or suspendForResult() instead.
	// Java projects can also use await() which is blocking.
	.enqueue()
```

```java
writeCharacteristic(someCharacteristic, someData, BluetoothGattCharacteristic.WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE)
	// Outgoing data can use automatic splitting.
	.split(customSplitter, progressCallback  /* optional */)
	// .split() with no parameters uses the default MTU splitter.
	// Kotlin projects can use .splitWithProgressAsFlow(customSplitter) to get the progress as Flow.
	.before(device -> { /* called when the request is about to be executed */ })
	.with(device, data -> { /* called when the request has been executed */ })
	.done(device -> { /* called when the request has completed successfully */ })
	.fail(device, status -> { /* called when the request has failed */ })
	.invalid({ /* called when the request was invalid, i.e. the target device or given characteristic was null */ })
	.then(device -> { /* called when the request was finished with either success, or a failure */ })
	// Remember to enqueue each request.
	.enqueue()
```

```java
readCharacteristic(someCharacteristic)
	// Incoming data can use automatic merging.
	.merge(customMerger, progressCallback /* optional */)
	// Kotlin projects can use .mergeWithProgressAsFlow(customMerger) to get the progress as Flow.
	// Incoming packets can also be filtered, so that not everything goes to the merger.
	.filter(dataFilter)
	// Complete, merged packets can also be filtered.
	.filterPacket(packetFilter)
	// [...]
	.with(device, data -> { /* called when the data have been received */ })
	// [...]
	// Once again, remember to enqueue each request!
	.enqueue()
```
All requests are automatically enqueued and executed sequentially.

#### GATT Client Example

Please refer to the `examples/ble-gatt-client folder` for a project that illustrates the GATT
server provided as a foreground service. There's a simple UI with a text field to update
with the value of a characteristic that can be read and subscribed to. This characteristic also
demands encryption as an illustration of best-practice.

You can run this client on one device and a complimenting server on another (see the next section).

#### GATT Server example

Starting from version 2.2 you may now define and use the GATT server in the BLE Library.

Please refer to the `examples/ble-gatt-server folder` for a project that illustrates the GATT
server provided as a foreground service. There's a simple UI with a text field to update
the value of a characteristic that can be read and subscribed to. This characteristic also
demands encryption as an illustration of best-practice.
